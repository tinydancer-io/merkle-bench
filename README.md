# Benchmarking Merkle Tree Construction for Receipts

This is a benchmark comparing merkle tree construction for receipts(Signature + Status). We are using two libraries for the comparison.

- [Solana-Merkle-Tree](https://crates.io/crates/solana-merkle-tree)
- [Firedancer bmtree32](https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/tree/main/src/ballet/bmtree)

**Note: bmtree32 is written in pure C. This benchmark currently uses FFI therefore there is a certain performance(due to lack of inlining and optimisation)**
